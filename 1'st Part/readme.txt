You have a two-dimensional list in the following format:
Each sub-list contains two items, and each item in the sub-lists is an integer.
Write a function process_data()/processData() that processes each sub-list like so:

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.
For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out: 2, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 2, 2, 2

This is an interview question asked by Uber.
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive.
Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters
is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

Examples:
- "the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
- "The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
