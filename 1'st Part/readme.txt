You have a two-dimensional list in the following format:
Each sub-list contains two items, and each item in the sub-lists is an integer.
Write a function process_data()/processData() that processes each sub-list like so:

Compute the running median of a sequence of numbers. That is, given a stream of numbers, print out the median of the list so far on each new element.
Recall that the median of an even-numbered list is the average of the two middle numbers.
For example, given the sequence [2, 1, 5, 7, 2, 0, 5], your algorithm should print out: 2, 1.5, 2, 3.5, 2, 2, 2

This is an interview question asked by Uber.
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive.
Implement a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters
is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

Convert number to reversed array of digits
Given a random non-negative number, you have to return the digits of this number within an array in reverse order.
